# v-stdlib remediation plan

A whole-library adversarial review of v-stdlib (the 6 shipped `VSL*` modules,
their tests, examples, generated docs, KIDS build, Python tooling, and the
planning corpus in the `docs` repo). `quarantine/` is out of scope by
instruction. This document records the findings as a **prioritized remediation
plan** plus a **sysadmin-facing extension roadmap**.

> **R1 is already landed in the same change as this document.** The broken
> `$$user^VSLSEC` public API has been fixed and re-verified (12/12 live on
> `vehu`). Everything below R1 is proposed, not yet done.

## Status tracker (R1–R8)

Live status of every remediation item. Update this row when an item lands.

| ID | Sev | Area | Summary | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | BLOCKER | VSLSEC | `$$user` had no body → raised on every call | ✅ DONE (12/12 live, commit `19b96b3`) |
| R2 | Major | VSLCFG | silent-fail `$$set`; SYS-only `$$get` mislabeled as "config" | ✅ DONE (loud `$$set`+`$$lastError`+`$$getEffective`; **dual-engine 7/7** — IRIS arm closed 2026-06-28 by a fixture fix: XPAR "ALL" ≠ SYS-settable) |
| R3 | Major | VSLLOG | not a real audit log (single `.01`, no DD/fields/query) | ✅ **DONE** — **R3a** dedicated `VSL AUDIT` DD #999001 + structured `$$write`/`$$read`; **R3b** `$$query` (event + date-range filters) over the new **VSLFS finder verbs (R-EXT-6: `$$find`/`$$list`)**. Dual-engine green (VSLFSTST 12/12, VSLLOGTST 15/15, vehu+foia-t12). Unblocked by v-pkg **B.2-a**. File # is test-range #999001 until B.2-b |
| R4 | Minor | VSLIO | `$$connect` timeout default doc (10) ≠ code (30) | ✅ DONE — doc + header now say 30 (match code) |
| R5 | Minor | VSLTASK/VSLFS | `when` doc imprecise; `$$kill` swallow-vs-raise asymmetry | ✅ DONE — `when` reworded to the full-$H/ZTDTH form; `$$kill` doc states the asymmetry is deliberate + points delete-or-fail callers at `$$lastError` |
| R6 | Structural | tests/examples/tooling | triplicated assertions; 356-col example lines; no empty-body gate | ✅ DONE (fall-through gate `tools/check-fallthrough.py`; test suites made canonical — long multi-statement `@example`s demoted to `@illustrative` pointers, lint M-MOD-001 19→0; golden fixture extended to cover `@illustrative`/`@raisesnodemo`. 6:1 tooling ratio = accepted observation) |
| R7 | Structural | docs/vsl-msl | published corpus stale (8 modules/`*1.0*2`; reality 6/`*1.0*7`) | ✅ DONE — all 7 `docs/vsl-msl/` docs marked `status: superseded` with a delta banner pointing to this repo as the source of truth (docs repo commit `b1b49fb`); link-check clean |
| R8 | Hygiene | git | uncommitted staged deletion on `main` | ✅ DONE (pruned in `19b96b3`) |

## Verdict

The core is **sound**: 6 thin, single-purpose adapters, each binding exactly
one VistA subsystem (XPAR, Kernel `^XUSEC`, FileMan DBS, `^%ZISTCP`, a FileMan
audit sink, TaskMan) to the engine-neutral `STD*` base, one-way `v → m`, with a
consistent loud-error contract and live dual-engine tests. The waterline
discipline holds. The risk is concentrated in (a) one shipped-and-broken public
API (now fixed), (b) a handful of smaller module defects, (c) heavy
generated-tooling overhead that already caused (a), and (d) a published plan
corpus that no longer matches the shipped 6-module reality.

Gate state at review: `make check-fast` is green (exit 0) apart from 16
non-error `M-MOD-001` style findings (see R6).

## Remediation items (severity-ranked)

### R1 — BLOCKER (DONE): `$$user^VSLSEC` had no body; every call raised

`$$user^VSLSEC(duz)` is a documented public API (module header, `VSLSECTST`,
the quick-start guide). Its implementation **did not exist**: the label at
`src/VSLSEC.m` was followed only by doc comments, so execution fell through into
`bySecid(secid)` and — with `secid` undefined — hit
`if $get(secid)="" do raiseArg(...) quit ""`, **raising `U-VSL-SEC-ARG` on every
call** (or, worse, returning a SecID-query IEN instead of a name if a caller had
`secid` leaked in scope).

**Root cause** (pickaxe-confirmed): commit `d13b9ac`
*"Living Examples E3 … coverage 0%→100%"* replaced the only executable line —

```diff
-	quit $$get^VSLFS(200,$$pduz(duz)_",",".01","")
+	; doc: @illustrative  resolves the #200 NAME via $$GET1^DIQ …
```

The example-backfill tooling deleted the function body while rewriting the doc
tags around it. No gate caught it because none execute `$$user` on a live
engine, and the "dual-engine green" claim in
`docs/memory/m6.5-vslsec-secid-binding.md` predates the regression.

**Fix applied:** restored `quit $$get^VSLFS(200,$$pduz(duz)_",",".01","")` (kept
the `@illustrative` doc line above it). Regenerated KIDS + manifest + module
page + examples + skill. Re-ran the live suite:
`VSLSECTST` **12/12 on `vehu` (ydb)**, including the previously-impossible
`$$user resolves the #200 NAME for IEN 1` assertion.

**Follow-up (proposed):** add a gate that fails on a public label whose body is
empty / falls through to the next label without an explicit `quit`. This class
of bug — a generated doc-edit silently deleting code — must be caught
mechanically, not by review. See R6.

### R2 — MAJOR: `VSLCFG` is silent-failing and SYS-scope-only, but named as a general config adapter

Two defects, both real:

1. **Silent failure.** `$$set^VSLCFG` calls `EN^XPAR("SYS",key,1,value)` with
   no error array and no `$$lastError`. It is the **only** module in the library
   with no loud-error contract — every other module raises a clean `,U-VSL-*-,`
   `$ECODE` and stashes detail for `$$lastError`. A bad parameter name or an
   XPAR validation failure vanishes silently.
2. **SYS-only, not "effective".** `$$get` reads `$$GET^XPAR("SYS",key,1)` — the
   SYS-level instance only, never XPAR's effective precedence resolution
   (`USR → SERVICE → DIV → SYS → PKG`). Labelled a "VistA configuration
   adapter," it is really a SYS-scope reader. A sysadmin asking "what is the
   effective value in this context?" gets the wrong answer.

**Done ✅ (dual-engine, IRIS arm closed 2026-06-28):**
- `$$set` is now loud — it reads `EN^XPAR`'s scalar error return (`0` vs
  `#^errortext`, where `#` is the VA FileMan DIALOG #.84 entry; grounded against
  the Kernel Toolkit DG, ICR #2263) **and** flag-traps a hard `EN^XPAR` fault,
  mapping either to a clean `,U-VSL-CFG-SET,` `$ECODE` with the detail in
  `^TMP($job,"vslcfg","err")`. Added `$$lastError^VSLCFG` (matches the
  VSLFS/VSLLOG/VSLTASK posture; flag-based `$ETRAP`, never zgoto).
- Added `$$getEffective^VSLCFG(key,default)` over `$$GET^XPAR("ALL",key,1)` —
  XPAR walks the parameter's own precedence multiple (#8989.51) and returns the
  first level that has a value, i.e. what the value actually resolves to in
  context. The existing SYS-only `$$get` is kept (the faithful `STDENV` flat-read
  analog) and the header now documents the `$$get` vs `$$getEffective` distinction.
- Tests: `VSLCFGTST` adds `tGetEffectiveResolvesSys` + `tSetFailureIsLoud`;
  **7/7 dual-engine — vehu (ydb) + foia-t12 (iris), IRIS arm closed 2026-06-28.**

> **✅ R2 IRIS arm closed (2026-06-28):** the foia arm was NOT free —
> `tGetEffectiveResolvesSys` was 6/7 on foia (green on vehu). Root cause is a real
> XPAR property, not a VSLCFG bug: a parameter can accept a **SYS instance** yet
> **omit SYS from its PRECEDENCE multiple**, so `$$GET^XPAR("ALL",p,1)` returns `""`
> — and *which* params do this differs by engine/instance. The test now asserts
> `$$getEffective` equals the **actual** `$$GET^XPAR("ALL")` resolution (+ default),
> proving the wrapper + default contract without depending on the dynamically-picked
> param's precedence. (An over-tightened fixture that probed many params for an
> ALL-resolver instead **aborted the IRIS suite 0/0** — a probed param faulted XPAR
> mid-probe; reverted to the quick SYS pick.) See memory `r2-vslcfg-loud-effective`.

**Deferred to `VSLPARM`** (do NOT build a second time in VSLCFG): entity-aware
`$$set`/`list` (`GETLST^XPAR`/`ENVAL^XPAR`, ICR #2263) belong in the suite's
`VSLPARM` module, which subsumes VSLCFG. R2 fixes the two real defects (silent
failure, SYS-only read) without growing VSLCFG into VSLPARM's territory.

### R3 — MAJOR: `VSLLOG` is not really an audit log

`$$write^VSLLOG` concatenates `timestamp_" "_event_" "_detail` into a **single
FileMan `.01`** of whatever file you pass; the tests use #8989.51 PARAMETER
DEFINITION as the "audit file." There is no dedicated audit DD, no structured
fields (DUZ, host, event-type, timestamp-as-field), and no query path. As the
"audit log must never silently drop a record" capability it claims (plan §6.2),
today's `VSLLOG` is a placeholder — a fine v→v composition demo, inadequate as
an operational audit sink.

This is the **prerequisite** for every write-capable module in the sysadmin
suite (`VSLKEY`, `VSLALERT`, `VSLUSER`, `VSLAUD`): privileged writes must be
auditable. See the extension-roadmap section below.

**Proposed:** define a dedicated `VSL AUDIT` FileMan DD (fields: timestamp, DUZ,
host/$IO, event category, free-text detail) shipped in the VSL KIDS build via
`v pkg`, and rebind `$$write^VSLLOG` to file structured fields through VSLFS.
Add `$$query^VSLLOG` (date/event filters) over the VSLFS finder (R-EXT-6).

> **🔶 R3a DONE — R3b deferred (2026-06-28):** v-pkg **B.2-a** (multi-field DD
> authoring) landed and is live-install-proven on both engines, so the multi-field
> DD shipped. **R3a (done):** a dedicated `VSL AUDIT` file (#999001, `^DIZ(999001,`)
> with `.01` EVENT + TIMESTAMP (date) + USER NUMBER (numeric DUZ, 0 = system) + HOST
> + DETAIL, declared in `kids/vsl.build.json` and shipped via `v pkg`; `$$write^VSLLOG`
> now owns the file (dropped the `file` param — the "foreign file" defect) and files
> structured typed fields through VSLFS; `$$read^VSLLOG(iens,.rec)` returns them.
> Dual-engine **11/11** (vehu YDB + foia-t12 IRIS) over the driver stack. **R3b
> (done):** `$$query^VSLLOG(.out,event,fromDt,toDt)` filters audit records by exact
> event and/or FileMan internal date range — built over the new **VSLFS finder verbs
> (R-EXT-6): `$$find`** (`$$FIND1^DIC`, unique) and **`$$list`** (`LIST^DIC`, all
> IENS), plus a `$$get` `"I"` internal-read flag (external dates don't sort). No
> direct data-global access — all record reads go through the VSLFS seam. Dual-engine
> green (VSLFSTST 12/12, VSLLOGTST 15/15). **Stopgap still true:** the file number is
> the VA-reserved test-range #999001 until v-pkg **B.2-b** ships permanent-namespace
> numbers.

### R4 — MINOR: `VSLIO` doc/code default mismatch

`$$connect` doc says `timeout … (default 10)`; the code is `$get(timeout,30)`
(default 30). The public-API header omits the default entirely. Fix the doc to
30 (or the code to 10) and state it in the header. The TLS gap itself is handled
correctly (loud `,U-VSLIO-NOTLS,`, never a silent plaintext fallback) and stays
tracked as the existing gating item — no change beyond the doc.

> **✅ R4 DONE (2026-06-28):** `@param timeout` doc corrected to `default 30`
> (matching the code), and the `$$connect` signature + `(timeout in seconds;
> default 30)` note added to the public-API header. Doc-only; regenerated the
> module page. The TLS gating item is unchanged.

### R5 — MINOR: `VSLTASK` `when` doc imprecise; `VSLFS.$$kill` asymmetry

- `VSLTASK.schedule` doc: *"MUST be ≤5-digit $H or `@`"*. The default is
  `$horolog` (full `days,secs`), which is the correct `ZTDTH` format; the
  "5-digit" phrasing is misleading. Reword.
- `VSLFS.$$kill` swallows a `DIERR` (idempotent) while `$$set` raises — a
  documented but trap-able asymmetry (a failed delete reads as success).
  Consider a `$$kill` variant (or flag) that raises, for callers that need
  delete-or-fail. Low priority.

> **✅ R5 DONE (2026-06-28):** doc-only, both items. `VSLTASK.schedule`'s `when`
> param reworded — the misleading "≤5-digit $H" replaced with "a full `$H` value
> (`days,secs`, e.g. `$HOROLOG`), or `@` for ASAP — not a bare day number; default
> `$HOROLOG` = now." `VSLFS.$$kill`'s swallow-vs-raise asymmetry is now documented
> in its header (`@returns bool 1 always (idempotent)` + the explicit note that
> callers needing delete-or-fail must check `$$lastError^VSLFS()` after `$$kill`).
> The raising `$$kill` *variant* stays deferred (low priority). Regenerated module
> pages.

### R6 — STRUCTURAL: triple-duplicated assertions, over-long example lines, tooling overhead

- **Triplication.** The same assertions exist in three places: the
  `@example`/`@illustrative` doc tags in each source module, the generated
  `examples/programs/VSL*EX.m`, and the hand-written `tests/VSL*TST.m`
  (compare `VSLTASKEX.m` to `VSLTASKTST.m` — near-identical). Three copies to
  keep in sync; **R1 proves the sync is fragile** — editing the doc-tag copy
  silently broke the real code.
- **Over-long lines.** All 16 lint findings are `M-MOD-001` (lines up to 356
  columns) caused by packing whole multi-statement M programs into `; doc:
  @example` comments. They pass only because the gate is `--error-on=error`.
  This is exactly the "exhaust" the org `org-knowledge-canonicalization`
  proposal targets.
- **Tooling-to-product ratio ≈ 6:1.** `tools/` holds ~200 KB of Python
  (`run-examples.py` 31 KB, `gen-manifest.py` 29 KB, `gen-examples.py` 24 KB,
  `gen-icr.py` 15 KB, …) supporting ~35 KB of M source across 6 modules. The
  drift-gate/generate discipline is the org standard, but at this scale the
  meta-machinery dwarfs the library and is itself a bug surface (it caused R1).

**Proposed:**
- ✅ **DONE** — the **empty-body / fall-through gate** from R1's follow-up
  (`tools/check-fallthrough.py`, in `make gates`/`check-fast`). The single
  highest-ROI mechanical guard, since it would have caught R1 at commit time:
  fed the exact R1-broken `VSLSEC` it flags `$$user` as "empty body — falls
  through to the next label". Engine-free, string/paren-aware (an embedded
  `quit` in a `$etrap` string, a postconditional `quit:cond`, and an `if`-gated
  quit are all correctly rejected as terminators); 49/49 labels clean today;
  10-case `--self-test`.
- Decide one source of truth for assertions. Preferred: the **test suites are
  canonical**; `@example` tags carry only short, genuinely self-contained
  one-liners (the rest become `@illustrative` pointers to the suite). This
  collapses the triplication to a duplication and removes the 356-column lines.
- Treat the tooling as a product with its own minimal test (the
  `tools/fixtures/` golden slice exists; extend it to cover the
  doc-tag-rewrite path that deleted R1).

> **✅ R6 DONE (2026-06-28).** All three bullets:
> 1. **Fall-through gate** — done earlier (`tools/check-fallthrough.py`, in `gates`).
> 2. **One source of truth for assertions (test suites canonical).** Every
>    multi-statement `@example` that merely re-encoded a test-suite assertion was
>    removed: where the label kept a short runnable one-liner the long copy was
>    **deleted** (VSLCFG `get`, VSLSEC `hasKey`/`bySecid`); where the demoted
>    scenario is genuinely non-demonstrable as a safe one-liner (a live mutation,
>    live data, or a bare-engine-absent API) it became an **`@illustrative`
>    pointer** naming the canonical `tests/VSL*TST.m` test (the `set`/`lastError`
>    error-demos, the held-key/SecID/#200-NAME live paths). The over-long
>    `@illustrative` *reason* lines and one prose note were shortened/wrapped.
>    Result: **`M-MOD-001` 19 → 0** (no source line over 200 cols); the test
>    suites are now the single canonical assertion source. **Convention recorded:**
>    `@illustrative` is for genuinely non-demonstrable scenarios only — a label
>    that retains a runnable `@example` gets the long duplicate *deleted*, not
>    tagged illustrative.
> 3. **Tooling-as-product test.** The golden parser fixture
>    (`tools/fixtures/VSLGOLD.m` + `vslgold-manifest-slice.json`) gained a `bye`
>    label exercising **`@illustrative` + `@raisesnodemo`** (previously only
>    `@example` was frozen), so the parser contract for the exact tags this
>    remediation relies on is now drift-gated.
>
> The **6:1 tooling-to-product ratio** is left as an accepted observation, not an
> action item — the generate/drift-gate discipline is the org standard and the
> ratio is an artifact of a 6-module library, not a defect.

### R7 — STRUCTURAL: the published plan corpus is stale and misleading

The `docs` repo `docs/vsl-msl/` (overview, plan, tracker, retrospective) froze
2026-06-18 and now asserts **8 VSL modules** (`…/VSLENV/VSLBLD`) at KIDS
`VSL*1.0*2`. Reality: **6 modules at patch 5** (VSLENV/VSLBLD deleted
2026-06-25; KIDS now `VSL*1.0*5`). The tracker never recorded the RPC/HL7→S3 tap
saga or its 2026-06-27 quarantine. The retrospective's headline "next move" (the
seven web clients) points at proposals **retired 2026-06-22**. Anyone trusting
that corpus is wrong on module count, patch level, and next steps.

**✅ DONE (2026-06-28, docs repo commit `b1b49fb`).** All **7** live `docs/vsl-msl/`
docs (overview, retrospective, architecture, coordination-plan, kickoff, README,
https-stack-spec) were marked `status: superseded` with a banner stating the deltas
(6 modules not 8; KIDS `VSL*1.0*7`; web stack + 7 web clients retired 2026-06-22;
RPC→S3 tap quarantined 2026-06-27) and pointing to **this repo** as the live source
of truth (`docs/proposals/v-stdlib-remediation-plan.md` + `docs/modules/` +
`docs/memory/`). The implementation plan + tracker were already in
`docs/archive/vsl-msl/`. Files kept in place (cross-repo inbound links would break
on a move); the architecture/coordination banners note their design content is
largely still valid. `doc-framework/tools/link-check.py` clean; docs-repo memory
[[msl-vsl-coordination-plan]] updated.

### R8 — HYGIENE: uncommitted deletion on `main`

`git status` showed a staged deletion of `docs/prompts/debug-live-capture-fault.md`
(tap-quarantine fallout) sitting uncommitted on `main`, contrary to the
increment protocol. Fold it into the next commit.

> **✅ R8 DONE (verified 2026-06-28).** The deletion was already folded into the
> R1 commit `19b96b3` ("fix(VSLSEC): restore $$user body; add adversarial
> remediation plan") — `docs/prompts/debug-live-capture-fault.md` (and the now-empty
> `docs/prompts/` folder) is gone from `HEAD` and the working tree is clean. No
> further action; this row is bookkeeping. (`docs/prompts/` was a bespoke folder the
> org docs-layout standard removes anyway — see the layout vocabulary in the org
> `CLAUDE.md`.)

## Are the existing plans worthwhile?

| Thread | Keep? | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Core ladder M0a→M6 (`v pkg` lifecycle + 6 adapters) | **Yes** | Lean, shipped, grounded. The defensible heart. |
| Real TLS (`$$connectTls`) | **Yes — gating** | Already loud-stubbed; needed before any PHI transport. |
| Dedicated audit DD (real `VSLLOG`) | **Yes** | R3 — prerequisite for every write-capable sysadmin module. |
| RS256/JWKS, OAuth introspection (`VWEBAOI`) | Conditional | Only if the web-resource-server line is actually pursued. |
| RPC/HL7→S3 traffic tap | **Built then quarantined** | ~12 increments discarded (wrong broker seam). Replacement `v-rpc-tap` spec churned 5× in one day. High-risk, low-yield so far; out of scope here. |
| VSLENV / VSLBLD / VSLTAPRUN / egress hash | **Deleted** | Built, then ruled out (bespoke-installer ban / over-engineering). |
| The 7 web clients + quality framework | **Retired** | XL program-scale speculation, no shipped consumer. |

**Pattern:** the drift-gated *core* lands and holds; the *speculative* work above
the M6 line repeatedly builds-then-discards, and the published roadmap, the live
activity, and the canonical tracker point in three different directions. R7
closes that gap.

## Sysadmin extension roadmap — defer to the existing suite proposal

The "what new modules do sysadmins need" question is **already answered** by the
canonical `docs/proposals/vista-sysadmin-suite.md` (draft 2026-06-27, rev 2) — a
grounded 46 KB design that turns v-stdlib from seam adapters into the engine half
of a sysadmin suite, each `VSL*` module paired with a Go `v` CLI domain:

| Tier | Modules | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — API-backed spine (build first) | `VSLJOB`, `VSLALERT`, `VSLPARM`, `VSLKEY`, `VSLERR` | TaskMan ops, XQALERT, XPAR, `^XUSEC` keys, error trap |
| 2 — FileMan-DBS wrappers | `VSLUSER`, `VSLDEV`, `VSLAUD` | users, devices, audit |
| 3 — monitors | `VSLHLO`, `VSLSTAT` (`VSLCAP` deferred) | HL7 links, system status |

**This remediation plan does not re-propose those modules.** An earlier review
draft invented overlapping names (`VSLOPS`/`VSLTM`/`VSLHL7`) — that would have
been naming drift against an existing design, the exact inconsistency this review
exists to catch. Adopt the suite's registry. The items below are the
**prerequisite cleanup the suite assumes but does not itself cover**, plus the
dependency edges between the two documents.

### Where this plan feeds the suite

- **R1 (fixed) is foundational to the whole suite.** The suite's `VSLUSER` and
  `VSLKEY` explicitly *reuse* `VSLSEC` (identity / key check), and
  `VSLUSER`/`VSLDEV`/`VSLAUD` reuse `VSLFS`. A broken `$$user^VSLSEC` would have
  propagated into every Tier-2 module. **Fix the base before building on it** —
  R1 did.
- **R3 (real `VSLLOG` audit DD) is a hard prerequisite for the suite's write
  verbs.** The suite states every gated write audits through `VSLLOG`/`VSLAUD`;
  today's `VSLLOG` is a single-`.01` placeholder. Build R3 *before* any
  write-capable suite module (`VSLKEY`, `VSLALERT`, `VSLUSER`, `VSLJOB` writes).
  R3 and the suite's `VSLAUD` should be designed together (likely the same DD).
- **R2 (VSLCFG loud + effective resolution) overlaps the suite's `VSLPARM`.**
  Decide: fold R2 into `VSLPARM`'s design (preferred — one XPAR module,
  entity-aware, loud) or fix `VSLCFG` standalone first. Do **not** ship both a
  SYS-only silent `VSLCFG` and a separate `VSLPARM` with divergent contracts.
- **`VSLFS` finder verbs** (`$$find`/`list` over `$$FIND1^DIC`/`LIST^DIC`) are
  the missing query surface the suite's Tier-2 FileMan wrappers and the planned
  `v db` domain both need. Pull this forward as a VSLFS increment ahead of Tier 2.

### Net positioning

- **This document** = prerequisite remediation (R1–R8): fix what's broken, harden
  the contracts, add the empty-body gate, reconcile the stale corpus.
- **`vista-sysadmin-suite.md`** = the forward capability roadmap (new `VSL*`
  modules + `v` domains).
- Sequence the suite's Tier 1 → 2 → 3 **after** R3 lands (write auditing) and with
  R2 folded into `VSLPARM`.

## Recommended sequence

1. **R1** — `$$user` fix (DONE, in this change).
2. **R6 empty-body/fall-through gate** — DONE (`tools/check-fallthrough.py`).
3. **R7 — DONE** — `docs/vsl-msl/` corpus (7 docs) marked `superseded` with a delta
   banner pointing to this repo (docs commit `b1b49fb`).
4. **R3 — DONE** — real `VSLLOG` audit DD: **R3a** dedicated `VSL AUDIT` #999001 +
   structured `$$write`/`$$read`; **R3b** `$$query` (event + date-range) over the
   VSLFS finder. Dual-engine green. Unblocks every suite write verb; co-design the
   DD with the suite's `VSLAUD`.
5. **R2 — DONE** — fix `VSLCFG` (loud `$$set` + `$$getEffective` resolution);
   **7/7 dual-engine, IRIS arm closed 2026-06-28.** Entity-aware verbs folded into
   the suite's `VSLPARM`.
6. **`VSLFS` finder verbs (R-EXT-6) — DONE** (`$$find`/`$$list` + `$$get` internal
   flag, dual-engine 12/12). Feeds R3b's `$$query` and the suite's Tier-2 wrappers
   and `v db`.
7. Then hand off to **`vista-sysadmin-suite.md`** Tier 1 → 2 → 3 (read verbs first
   within each tier; gated writes only after R3).
8. **R4 / R5 — DONE** — minor contract docs (VSLIO timeout default, VSLTASK `when`
   wording, VSLFS `$$kill` asymmetry note), folded into the module touch of
   2026-06-28. **R8 — DONE** — the stray staged deletion was pruned in the R1
   commit `19b96b3`; HEAD + working tree clean.

**All remediation items (R1–R8 + R-EXT-6) are now closed.** Read-only, low-risk,
highest-daily-value capabilities came first; dangerous writes were deferred until
the audit substrate (R3) existed. Next: hand off to the sysadmin-suite Tier 1→2→3.

## Appendix — findings table

| ID | Sev | Area | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | BLOCKER | VSLSEC | `$$user` had no body → raised on every call | **Fixed + verified 12/12 live** |
| R2 | Major | VSLCFG | silent-fail `$$set`; SYS-only `$$get` mislabeled as "config" | **Done — loud `$$set`/`$$lastError`/`$$getEffective`, dual-engine 7/7 (IRIS arm closed 2026-06-28)** |
| R3 | Major | VSLLOG | not a real audit log (single `.01`, no DD/fields/query) | **DONE** — R3a dedicated `VSL AUDIT` DD #999001 + structured `$$write`/`$$read`; R3b `$$query` over the new VSLFS finder verbs (R-EXT-6). Dual-engine green (12/12 + 15/15); unblocked by v-pkg B.2-a |
| R4 | Minor | VSLIO | `$$connect` timeout default doc (10) ≠ code (30) | **Done — doc + header = 30 (match code)** |
| R5 | Minor | VSLTASK/VSLFS | `when` doc imprecise; `$$kill` swallow-vs-raise asymmetry | **Done — `when` reworded; `$$kill` asymmetry documented + `$$lastError` path** |
| R6 | Structural | tests/examples/tooling | triplicated assertions; 356-col example lines; 6:1 tooling ratio; no empty-body gate | **Done — fall-through gate (`tools/check-fallthrough.py`) + test suites made canonical (long `@example`s → `@illustrative` pointers, M-MOD-001 19→0) + golden fixture extended (`@illustrative`/`@raisesnodemo`). 6:1 ratio = accepted observation** |
| R7 | Structural | docs/vsl-msl | published corpus stale (8 modules/`*1.0*2`; reality 6/`*1.0*7`) | **Done** — 7 docs marked `superseded` + delta banner → this repo (docs commit `b1b49fb`) |
| R8 | Hygiene | git | uncommitted staged deletion on `main` | **Done — pruned in `19b96b3`; HEAD + working tree clean** |
